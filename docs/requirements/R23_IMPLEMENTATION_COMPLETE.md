### Code Architecture

#### API Layer
```typescript
// Example API implementation structure
export async function r23Handler(request: Request) {
  try {
    // Authentication and authorization
    const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
    
    // Input validation
    const validatedData = await validateInput(request);
    
    // Core business logic
    const result = await executeMulti-deviceSyncLogic(validatedData);
    
    // Response formatting
    return Response.json({ success: true, data: result });
  } catch (error) {
    return handleError(error);
  }
}
```

#### Component Structure
```typescript
// React component implementation
export function Multi-deviceSyncComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const handleMulti-deviceSync = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const result = await apiMulti-deviceSync();
      setState(result);
    } catch (error) {
      handleError(error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="implementation-container">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
