## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Architecture

### 1. Core AI Service (`/src/lib/pulsar-ai.ts`)

**PulsarAIService Class** - Comprehensive AI integration service:

```typescript
class PulsarAIService {
  // R34.1 - Creator Skill Assessment
  async assessCreatorSkill(userId: string): Promise<CreatorSkillLevel>
  
  // R34.2 - Intelligent Content Suggestions
  async generateContentSuggestions(params): Promise<ContentSuggestion[]>
  
  // R34.3 - Quality Scoring System
  async scoreContentQuality(content): Promise<QualityScore>
  
  // Enhanced AI Generation
  async generateContent(params): Promise<GenerationResult>
  async getCapabilities(): Promise<PulsarAICapabilities>
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Branded Pulsar AI models (pulsar-vision-v2, pulsar-sound-v2, etc.)
- Skill level analysis with confidence scoring
- Real-time content suggestions with reasoning
- Quality assessment with publication readiness
- Mock implementation for development with production-ready architecture

### 2. API Integration (`/src/app/api/ai/pulsar/route.ts`)

**RESTful API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/ai/pulsar` - Universal AI endpoint with action-based routing
- Actions: `assess-skill`, `generate-suggestions`, `score-quality`, `generate-content`, `get-capabilities`

**Enhanced Generation API** (`/src/app/api/ai/generate/route.ts`):
- Integrated with Pulsar AI service
- Returns skill assessment, suggestions, and quality scores with generation results
- Backwards compatible with existing generation interface

### 3. UI Components

#### A. Pulsar AI Dashboard (`/src/components/ai/pulsar-ai-dashboard.tsx`)
- **Skill Assessment Display**: Level, confidence, metrics
- **AI Suggestions Panel**: Personalized recommendations
- **Growth Path**: Next tools, skill building, challenges
- **Real-time Analytics**: Submission stats, completion rates

#### B. Intelligent Suggestions Panel (`/src/components/ai/intelligent-suggestions-panel.tsx`)
- **Real-time Prompt Analysis**: Debounced suggestion generation
- **Smart Prompt Enhancement**: AI-powered prompt improvements
- **Content-Type Specific Tips**: Tailored advice for image/music/video
- **Suggestion Application**: One-click prompt updates

#### C. Content Quality Scorer (`/src/components/ai/content-quality-scorer.tsx`)
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Creativity, technical, engagement, coherence
- **Publication Readiness**: Automated go/no-go assessment
- **Improvement Feedback**: Specific enhancement suggestions
- **Engagement Prediction**: Estimated views, likes, ranking
