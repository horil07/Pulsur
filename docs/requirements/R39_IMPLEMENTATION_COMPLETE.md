- API endpoint validation
- Component existence verification
- Feature functionality testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Daily Limit Testing**
   - Vote up to 3 times
   - Verify limit enforcement
   - Check reset at midnight

2. **Vote History Testing**
   - View complete vote history
   - Remove individual votes
   - Verify limit updates after removal

3. **Guest User Testing**
   - Attempt voting as guest
   - Verify login prompts
   - Test transition to authenticated flow

4. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Network failures
   - API errors
   - Edge cases (e.g., concurrent votes)

## ðŸ“Š Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed vote queries by user and date
- Efficient daily vote counting
- Minimal data transfer for limits API

### Client-Side Optimization
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Debounced API calls
- Local state management for immediate feedback

### Caching Strategy
- Vote limits cached on client
- Smart invalidation on vote actions
- Reduced server load for repeated checks

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

### Vote Manipulation Prevention
- Server-side limit enforcement
- Authentication required for persistent votes
- Rate limiting on vote endpoints

### Data Integrity
- Atomic vote operations
- Consistent limit checking
- Proper error handling

## ðŸ“ˆ Analytics Integration

### Vote Tracking
- Daily vote patterns
- User engagement metrics
- Limit effectiveness monitoring

### User Behavior
- Vote history analysis
- Feature usage tracking
- Conversion from guest to authenticated users

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate
